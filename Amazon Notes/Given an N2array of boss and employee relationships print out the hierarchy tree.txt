1. Create a String array, HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;, and a DiGraph 2. Popular each name in map and array, the integer value in the hashmap references the position in the string array such that they are inverted value of each other. 3. Verticies in the DiGraph references the position in the String array as well. 4. Add an edge to the graph for each manager - subordinate relationship. 5. Assuming the csv is accurate and there's no cycle, run DFS on the Graph and create reverse post order list of the verticies. That will give you the topological order of the company's hiearchy. 6. print the list in BFS order
