Elevator class:
It has a direction(up, down, stand, maintenance), a current floor and a list of floor requests sorted in the direction. It receives requests from this elevator.

There is a bank, which contains the elevators and receives the requests from the floors. These are scheduled to all active elevators(not in maintenance). 

Scheduling:
if available = pick a standing elevator for this floor
else: pick an elevator moving to this floor
else: pick a standing elevator on another floor
else: pick the elevator with the lowest load

Elevator states:
Maintenance: the elevator does not react to external signals(only to its own signals)
Stand: the elevator is fixed on a floor. If it receives a call. And the elevator is on that floor, the doors open.
If it is on another floor, it moves in that direction.
Up: The elevator moves up. Each time it reaches a floor, it checks if it needs to stop. If so it stops and opens the doors. It waits for a certain amount of time,
and closes the doors if there nothing between the doors.  Then it removes the floor from the request list and checks if there is another request. If so the elevator starts
moving again. If not it enters the state stand.

Down: like up but in reverse direction

Additional Signals:
Alarm: The elevator stops. And if it is on a floor, the doors open, the request list is cleared, the request moved back to the bank.

Door open: Opens the doors if an elevator is on a floor and not moving

Door closes: Closed the door if they are open
