Jigsaw Puzzle:

Edge case, what if the piece is a CORNER

Two classes:
Edge:
determines the type of edge each piece is, controls whether a certain edge will fit with other edges


Piece:
Array of edges.
checks if the piece is a corner piece

Puzzle:
An array of pieces
A two dimensional array of the puzzle solution

Array of edges called  inners
Array of edges called  outers
Array of edges called flats
Array of Pieces called corners

A sort method
A solve method
//Pseudo code for sorting 
void sort(){
 	for each Piece p in pieces {
 		if(p has two flat edges) then add p to corners
 		
 		for each edge in p.edges{
 			if edge is inner then add to inners
 			if edge is out then add to inners
 		}	
 	}
 }
 
 //Algo for solving
 1. Ataches the edge
 2. Removes the edge from the list of open edges
 3. Finds the next open edge
