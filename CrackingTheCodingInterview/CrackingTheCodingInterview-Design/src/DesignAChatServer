Design A Chat Server:

Questions to ask:

1. What specific actions does it need to support?
2. What can we learn about these requirements?
3. What are the core components of the system?
4. What are the key objects and methods?



Class: UserManager
-core user actions: add requests, add users, sign on, sign off


sendAddRequest:

1. User A clicks "add user" on the client and it gets sent to the server
2. User A calls requestAddUser(User B)
3. This method calls UserManager.addUser
4. UserManager calls both User A. sentAddRequest and User B.receivedAddRequest


End questions to ask:
How do we know if someone is online?
Can regularly ping the client to check 

How do we deal with conflicting information?

How do we make our server scale?
Split the chat server across multiple servers

How do we prevent denial of service attacks?
