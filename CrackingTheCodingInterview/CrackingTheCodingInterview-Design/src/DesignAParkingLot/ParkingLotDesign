ParkingLot Design:
Questions/Assumptions to ask/define?
1. What types of Vehicles does this parking lot support?(Trucks, SUVs, Busses)
2. Are there multiple levels? 
3. What are the mechanics of the parking spots? For example, does a BUS take up he same amount of space as an SUV.


Possible Assumptions:
1. The parking lot has multiple levels. Each level has multiple rows of spots.
2. The parking lot can park multiple motorcycles, cars, and buses.
3. The parking lot has motorcycle spots, compact spots, and large spots
4. A motorcycle can park in any spot
5. A car can park in either a single compact spot or a single large spot
6.  A bus can park in five large spots that are consecutive and within the same row. It cannot park in small spots.


The Parking lot class is a wrapper class for an array of levels. 

The ParkingSpot class is implemented by having just a variable which represents the size of the spot. We could have implemented
this by having classes for LargeSpot, CompactSpot, and MotorcycleSpot, which inherit from ParkingSpot.
